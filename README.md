# Train_Time

An app that calculates train times based on real time using Moment.js.
To store information, I used Firebase. 

This app is useful for those who want to discover what time a certain train will arrive at their station and how many minutes until that train arrives. By using moment.js, the times calculated are accurate as it is using the real world clock.

Users can get started by clicking on the deployed link below. 
First, the user must enter the train's name.
Next, enter the train's destination.
Then, the user must enter the first train arrival time.
Last, enter the number of minutes it takes for the train to arrive.
By clicking submit, the new train will be added to the list of train schedules above.
As a result, the train's next arrival and how many minutes away will appear as well.
